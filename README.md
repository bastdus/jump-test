```bash

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Guidelines

### import

Aliases are set up for `@/*` to import files from any directory in `./tsconfig.json`

```javascript
import { Input } from "@/components/ui";
```

### Queries

In order to avoid unnecessary refetching, the stale time are set globally to **30 minutes** in `./lib/queryClient.ts`

```javascript
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 30, // Change here if needed
    },
  },
});
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated time

To complete this project, it took me around **XX hours**.
